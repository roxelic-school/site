The way this website works i find to be really funny,<br>
Since this is a static website hosted on a cloudflare page, I couldnt use a live endpoint to hold the api data, so what i did was i made a script which would generate it and added it and add it to /public/api, the reasoning for this is so i could create a dynamic sidebar which i didnt have to update every time i made a new page which i figured i would be doing really often.<br>
this website itself is build using the [astro](//astro.build) framework, which i highly recommend to any one looking to make a website. It was really easy to learn and they have some amazing documentation<br>
if you would like to check out my main websites please have a look at

and if you are looking at this later in development when spotify approves my computer science project to gain full use of their api you will be able to view my project here
- [music.foreverpain.lol](//music.foreverpain.lol)<br>
but until then no one will be able to sign up except the ones that i personally authorise with their email on the spotify developer console, sorry about that so you will get an error which reads `error logging into spotify` if you try to do so while it is still under the development api limitations<br>
lastly if you would like to check out some more things i made please have a look at my github
