## Welcome,
This website is where I will put all the content from my school work, so i can easilly access it at all times and write it in a way which i find to be easier and looks much better in my opinion,
It will hold the work from my computer science and games design courses
- computer sceince 
    - [A-level]
- games design
    - [level3 B-tech]

There is a searchbar that will allow you to sift through the content based on title, description and tags. It does this by looking through the [api](/api/fileparse.json) of this website, if you would like to learn more about how it does this, please visit either
- [the github repo](https://github.com/roxelic-school/site)
or
- [this page](./web)
