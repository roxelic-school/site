## LOG: 30/09/2-24
With 3 weeks to go, my game is currently unstarted

Today i plan to model a few trees that i intend to use in world gen, as it will be randomly placed on load using a pcg plugin,
It didn't go well, i have no tree and no blender add ones apparently so i had to try using the 2.9 version which had it but its improperly rendering my tree now so.
Originally i tried getting a pre made 3d model of a tree or something from an asset pack but they all turned out to be really high polly which these computers couldn't handle, so then i tried modeling one, originally i used a stick with a curve modifier attached to a curve which worked pretty well but it would have been difficult to animate so next i tried using bones which i found to work. Then i couldn't figure out how to model the tree itself so i asked for help from alex and i was told to follow a tutorial using the blender sapling generator plugin which blender 4 didn't have so im using the pre installed version 2.9 blender. That's where i ended the day,

With 3 weeks to go, yesterday i began practicing with the blender 2.9 plugin for sapling tree gen

Today i plan to finish my tree model and import it successfully into my unreal project as well as working on the procedural tree gen and ground textures.
My older unreal project was lost so i started again by making a first person template, once i did this i made a 3d open world level where i tried to import my newly finished tree model but these computers are having a hard time importing it. That was all of today, i attempted to add usage of the PCG plugin to generate my trees but the computer struggled massively attempting to load 20 instances of my tree. Tomorrow i will try and make them less polly and if that doesn't work place them manually
