## Game balance: Archetype vs other archetype
Taking the general base of TF2’s Scout and Heavy, a fast and high single-damage character with low health, vs a slow moving and high sustained-damage character with high health. Their balance works because the Scout has the ability to utilise his movement capabilities and aiming skill to confuse the Heavy, who has the luxury of having to move very little as he can tank the damage, and focus his mental resources onto his aim. This works for balance as it means that the winner is largely dependent on the player’s individual skill, rather than the class they are playing.

For example: if the Scout has great movement abilities whereas the Heavy has sub-par aiming capabilities, the Scout will be able to throw off the aim of the Heavy and win. Whereas if the Scout has poor movement skills, he will not be able to take the sustained fire of the Heavy and will die.

## How this could be improved
This could be improved by introducing both environmental elements and player cooldowns so it's not as simple as a character being an opposite or a counter but there are specific gameplay mechanics that introduce more gameplay elements (:
