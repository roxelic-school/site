## Game Balance: Archetype vs. Other Archetype

Taking the general base of TF2’s Scout and Heavy—a fast, high-damage character with low health versus a slow-moving, high-sustained-damage character with high health—their balance works because the Scout can utilize his movement capabilities and aiming skill to confuse the Heavy. The Heavy, on the other hand, has the luxury of moving very little since he can tank the damage, allowing him to focus his mental resources on his aim. This balance works as it means that the outcome is largely dependent on the player’s individual skill rather than the class they are playing.

For example, if the Scout has excellent movement abilities while the Heavy has poor aiming skills, the Scout will be able to disrupt the Heavy’s aim and win. Conversely, if the Scout has poor movement skills, he will not be able to withstand the sustained fire from the Heavy and will be defeated.

## How This Could Be Improved

This could be improved by introducing both environmental elements and player cooldowns so it's not as simple as a character being an opposite or a counter, but rather specific gameplay mechanics that introduce more gameplay elements (:

## What Is Balanced in a Game of My Choosing?

### Overwatch

Overwatch is an incredibly unbalanced game, as the community will tell you. Overwatch 1 was a massive success in 2016, leading to the announcement of a sequel not even a year later. When the game, which had been in development for six years, was finally released, the community was very excited for Overwatch 2. However, it was a massive disappointment, with the game switching from 6v6 to 5v5, which led to significant balance issues. The tank role, specifically, started off as extremely underpowered since it was designed for 2 tanks, 2 DPS, and 2 support. Without the supporting tank, the workload was massive, leading to a significant drop in players wanting to play the role and increased game wait times.

To balance Overwatch, I would suggest remaking the entire game. Nothing about it can be seen as "balanced" as it feels rushed and appears to be a money grab. After going free-to-play, the game had to find ways to make people spend money, which is another drawback. All changes made during the development and release of Overwatch 2 have not been beneficial.

## Ideas

### New Game Mechanic

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: Final Smash Mechanic
Since a Final Smash is used on an opponent, the kill is not always confirmed, regardless of the enemy’s percentage.

### Pokémon Go

Improve Pokémon Go battles
Remove paywalls

## Improvement

With the current Pokémon Go battles differing significantly from traditional Pokémon battles, there is a lack of player interaction and strategy. Returning to a more classic system, where the player selects moves based on types, would require players to engage with a level of strategy in their battles, making them more engrossing. Different move types would also allow for deeper strategy, as players could choose their moves more strategically. This would necessitate a fundamental change to the battle system, returning to a "turn-based" approach, otherwise, it would become dependent on who can navigate the menus the fastest.

## A Game That Was Recently Updated for Balance

### Deadlock

The new Valve "release," which is currently in live development and testing, means the game is receiving balance updates and changes almost weekly. The HP and DPS of the characters, as well as the health of the small candle-like characters, are changing rapidly, affecting the play experience. The developers are also taking suggestions from players who currently have access to the game, leading to updates that are necessary and beneficial for the game and its experience.
