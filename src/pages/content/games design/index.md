## Client
### Who is the Client, What are their values, philosophy and focus? What’s the brief? What are the requirements, context and audience?  

The client is unreal engine, they are an epic games game engine which has its own store it funnels to. The games that are typically created in unreal engine are 3D games that take advantage of its high level rendering capabilities, with it having the ability to emulate physics and light in a way where it is almost impossible to tell the difference between simulations powered by unreal engine 5 and videos taken with newer mobile phones that have very high camera qualities. Their most popular game made by epic games using unreal engine would be fortnight with it having multiple custom builds based around it. Unreal engine depicts itself as a game engine to be used for any kind of development but the ones it typically creates for itself are typically free to play with ingame payouts but occasionally they do make a large triple A game that is to show what the engine itself is capable of.
The brief that we have been given is to create a first person horror environment. The restrictions of this is that is refrains us from allowing the player to explore the player model with a third person camera and be more aware of their surroundings. This does however allow us to skip out on the modeling of the player character this then allowing us to spend more time on the environment itself. The goal of this is to make an environment that seems scary that will more than likely not have any “monster” in it. This will hopefully allow me to make some interactive elements using code and colliders, such as doors or falling items.
The requirements are to at least have an environment and a moveable player character, the audience is for 16 - 25 years old, the context would be that of a single player horror game. The asset packs that we will be given will set part of the context/environment because without the knowledge of the kind of assets that will be provided im unable to elaborate on what it will visually look like, use of a shader in this 3d game will set a large majority of the context and i would like to experiment with a 16 tone shader providing an older look while still retaining detail.

## Constraints
### What are the constraints? e.g. commercial context, time, budget, scope, format, platform, technical, materials and resources.

- The constraints that we are given are the player view, the game engine and the genera. This telling us that we have to use a first person horror game made in unreal engine
- I am a game developer developing a game for the client for unreal engine.
- The time in which we are able to develop this game is 6 weeks with 15 hours supported and 5 hours unsupported weekly. With the time that i am being given to develop this being so small i will have to use my own time and a large amount of free/public assets which shouldn't be too difficult as unreal has an inbuilt massive asset store.
- The scope is to create a 3d first person horror level, this involves making an environment with(out) interactive elements, this may or may not include a player character model with it being first person it is completely reasonable to use a capsule element instead, yet if we are using ray-tracing and reflective elements (which unreal specialises in) it would be much more immersive to make a player model
- The format it will be made in is a 3d horror game that is first person
- The platform this game is being commissioned for is pc and console
- I have both the software and hardware that is required to develop this game at home and at school meaning id be able to work on this program constantly preferably using the version control that is git
- The materials that are required would be, a game engine (unreal) an ide (visual studio community and visual studio code) and a spriting program (aseprite, compiled as school does not have a license)
- The resources will more than likely include google classroom and its children, git, unreal engine, asperite and vscode as this is a relatively small project
- No monetary budget but will be able to receive support from the school is desired or requested
#### project idea
- I'd like to create a project that is set in a sparse woodland with a mansion in the center, the mansion will be the centerpiece and its level of completion will depend on the time it takes for me to get used to unreal engine, if i am unable to develop it it will either not be there or have a “locked” door which i will overlay some basic wood models and just add no colliders and level it set with a gravity/force scale of 0. I'd like to include some sound design so id look for free sound assets across the internet and pull from there since the goal is to create an environment and the best way to do this is sound design

## Purpose
### What is the function of work such as entertainment, promotion, information, education. How do you intend to meet this need? Can you make links to other horror games? 

The purpose of this work is so that  i can create a horror “level” which will act as a practice for my skills, the games i plan to base this on are goosebumps for the nintendo 3ds, iron lung, faith the unholy trinity and luigi's mansion 2 (i know this is not a horror game but it has a similar settings and paranormal elements). It will be intended to provide entertainment to the ages of 16-25 who are interested in the horror genre. In the game goosebumps for the nintendo 3ds the game was created as promotional material for goosebumps the movie 2 so it contains a lot of information which leads up to the movie as well as having a cameo from the lead actor (jack black) as well as explaining why the character he played (r.l.stine) had moved into the position that he was in. Since the games were really popular with the younger audience of the show as well as it being a cheaper game than most games (originally selling for roughly £10) it would allow a ton of people who aren't really involved in online social spaces to get access to the movie. With it being a relatively small project i do not have a specific target for what it will “educate” on and it will more than likely be very similar to most environment and sound based horror games possibly educating about the paranormal if i get far enough. I do not personally believe in using promotional media in games as i think it should be on the same level as a movie as they are both providing an “experience” to the audience. In more detail to earlier my plan for the game itself is to have a abandoned mansion as the centerpiece of the map (using a 16 bit shader so it will still have realism and detail but also not at the same time which is removing some of the visibility from the player so i don't need to use something like fog to enhance the environment). Id also love to add some sort of paranormal element, doors closing, twigs breaking by themselves like `those who remain` (a supernatural horror game which i played on the xbox)

## Audience
### Who are your audience? What are their needs and interests? Create a profile of products that that appeal to them. 

The audience i plan to develop this game for is
- Sex - any
    * Anyone should be able to play my game, i don't see any specific gender stereotype preferring my game design over the other
- Age - 12-25
    * I plan for a younger demographic as it is no a legacy title with less gore and “creepy” elements
- Genera - gothic horror
    * I plan for my game to follow a more religious view when it comes to the horror elements of the game so I beleive that is the sub genera that would come under
- Location - europe 
    * With the language, setting and references the game will make will be revolving around my personal view on these things which would of course have been affected by where i am, the people i grew up around, and the culture such as how european and american “haunted houses” take on different appearances
- Occupation - unemployed
    * With my game taking a closer focus on a younger demographic it is very unlikely that the players would be of age to get married, have the money to get married and the time to get married

## Research
### Market Research. What similar work already exists. Analyse how they have been created e.g. recurring or specific techniques, targeting the audience, hitting the brand.

* Games researched:
    - Luigi's mansion 2: dark moon
    - Goosebumps: 3ds
    - Faith: the unhp;y trinity

# Luigi's mansion 2

## The 2013 spin off mario game made as a sequel to the 2003 game for the gamecube
After the instant success of the original luigi's mansion it was commonly leaked (by the very small leaking community on what was the internet at the time) that there would be a sequel at some point (all nintendo games have code names which usually can be followed along for each game, which does defeat the purpose, like for example marios development codename in nintendo is “red”) It is important to note that the game was a success and did turn a profit but it was considered a niche game which is why it took them almost 10 years to make a sequel.

## The games differences and goals
Since luigis mansion 2 was designed for a significantly more powerful console than its predecessor they were given the ability to create much more detailed and therefor expressive models and animations. This was the reasoning behind them replacing the original weapon with what was practically the same thing just to use the new opportunities they were able to include. Not only was there redesigned assets and animations but it also included multiple more mansions and even an online gamemode. This made the game so much more of a success than the first making it one of nintendo's most popular ds games even sparking a 3ds Xl special edition to be made.

As well as all of that one of its biggest accomplishments was taking advantage of the 3d screen to create interactive elements using all of the hardware they were able to. 

## The development timeline
* Concept and Planning Phase (2007-2009)
    - around this time is when nintendo where searching for and making mario based games constantly and is likely what influenced the decision to make this game but due to nintendo not sharing the process i can only guess that
* Pre-Production (2009-2010)
    - once the game was greenlit `Next Level Games ` (the company behind its development) began working on level design, and mechanics which is primarily similar to almost every game on the market
* Full Production (2010-2012)
    - asset production began here allowing them to switch out the placeholders that where previously made with real assets (this taking the longest amount of time as asset production normally would)
* Polishing and Testing (2012-2013)
    - now that the game had been finished it was just bug fixes and beta testing, since during the time of nintendo ds games it was uncommon for a game to receive updates after completion this was a crucial step before soon being released after

## Audience and demographic
Luigi’s mansion 2: Dark moon was created for the younger nintendo audience, with it taking a more childlike approach to level design with them being simplistic and having easy to navigate menus. Although with this being a legacy game it did include a large amount of extra content for older audiences, such as the previously mentioned online mode and collectable items (gems). The 3d aspect could also be classed as for older audiences as it was recommended for children to not use it but with the console it was designed for being built around 3d it would have been bad practice to not use the  hardware provided.

## Marketing and publishing
The games advert campaigns focused around the games paranormal and eerie atmosphere, The adverts did follow a trend of nintendo adverts where they allowed the levels sound design to fill in the gaps of the narrator speaking with this game they use it for doors, luigi’s screams (he does this a lot) and the sound effects from the ghosts. 
The posters for this game often used dark colors as well as only being taken in the first mansion which is the one that the original game was set in for 2 reasons, the first being that it was a familiar environment so that even with the new graphics and better designs it would still be easily recognisable and be able to build of the first games success and to hide the extra content (the extra mansions was shown in a few of the adverts through which does make sense but i thought it was important to clarify that i was only on about the instances of this in the posters)

# Goosebumps; the game

## Goosebumps: the game; developed by `wayforward technologies` as a tie in game for the upcoming movie
- The game sadly doesn't contain much new content as its only purpose was to tie into the upcoming movie but what it does contain is a cameo from almost every goosebumps monster (a ton of characters if you are unfamiliar with the series) which makes me believe this game was mostly centered around older fans.
- The style of this game is a point and click adventure. Which also allowed the player to do the story in whatever order they pleased (which very much got me lost as a child) The way to progress is to clear or trap all of the monsters which was really hard to do if you were unfamiliar with the series.

## The story and progression of the game
- The game starts off in a moving truck (which id like to point out is very similar to the start of the movie) where it is seen carrying all of the goosebump monsters, They are normally seen as harmless everyday items until something happens, as r.l.stine describes it “the beginning, the middle and the twist.” which is the formula which every goosebumps story follows. The truck is then forced to crash by what is assumed to be “slappy” the main monster who is seen as a ventriloquist dummy. The game then cuts to the player character walking home from school and on the way you encounter multiple “strange things” which are just the goosebumps monsters, one of them being entirely new but having very little explanation
- That being the bunny with the magic hat. Once the player has returned home they find that their once normal house had been transformed into a “haunted mansion” of sorts. The game progresses by solving puzzles and eventually heading to the mall to defeat slappy and find r.l.stine. In one of the many endings that you meet r.l.stine and talk with him which leads up to the movie.

## The development timeline
- The development timeline of the goosebumps game has not been recorded at all as this is mostly a throwaway title. So instead im going to talk about the history of goosebumps because i love it and it does very much fit into the topic. The author of goosebumps r.l.stine loved writing stories as a child, and when he became an adult it is all he always wanted to do and he did. He started goosebumps rather early in his career, after writing a series called fear street which was no where near as popular as goosebumps but it is currently running in a netflix series of ¾ movies and it has very good reviews. R.L.stein has made a book almost every 3 months for the last 40 years, and thats at the least. 
- The goosebumps series currently spans over 80 storied and this is not including re-writes or special editions with multiple subseries, which can all be seen on [rlstine.com/](//rlstine.com) in which he links to the scholasus pages for all his books/movies/series. There are a few goosebumps games but they have never really been a main focus of the series (which was the 90s tv show and the books) but the games that where produced where relatively high quality.

## Audience and demographic
The audience and demographic of the goosebumps 3ds game would have been similar to that of the movie this was made to promote, as it was a prelude to the movie. The movie was rated a pegi 12, it was given this rating as it “may contain some horror content that may make children uncomfortable”, however the game itself uses a rather simplistic style which did slightly tone down the pegi age rating from 12 to a “Ages 7 & Over”.

## Marketing and publishing
There was sadly very little marketing for this game, I myself found this game by watching youtube videos but i cannot find a single advertisement while looking now for it. This game was sold via nintendo and amazon, no other official publishers
