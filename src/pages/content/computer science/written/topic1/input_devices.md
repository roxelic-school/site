## 2d scanner
- The panel is raised, the document is placed on the glass and the cover is closed. a bright light illuminates the document
- a scan head moves across the document until the wholepage has been scanned and an image is produced
- image is focused and flass on a CCD and is converted to electronic form

## 3d scanner
- a 3d-scanner scans solid objects and a three-dimensional image representing the object is produced
- several images at various three-dimensional coordinates of the object are taken by the scanner

## barcode reader
- a barcode is a series of dark and light para;;pe; ;omes pf varying thickness
- the numbers 0 to 9 are each represented by a uniqe series of lines
- various barcode methods for representing these digits exist. universal produces code (UPC) defines a standard to represent each digit using bars
- the most common application of barcodes is a storing product information

## QR code reader
- a qr code is made up of a matrix of filled-in squares on a light background
<br>

- QR codes can store up to 7000 digits whereas normal barcodes can only store 30 digits
- with internet access, QR codes can be scanned anywhere
- they are widely used for advertising products
<FINISH THIS>
<br>

> QR code is scanned using phones camera
<br>

> the QR code is analysed
<br>

> phone number or advertisement it appeats on a smart devices screen

## digital cameras
- digital cameras have replaced traditional cameras because of thier many advantages
- traditional cameras require film and the photos must be developed and printed
- these cameras can be connected to a computer using USB, wifi or bluetooth connectivvity and the photos and videos can be transferred in seconds
<br>

- digital cameras have a microprocessor to automatically adjust the shutter speed, focus the image, operate the flash, adjust the aperture size, adjust the shutter speed, adjust the size of the image, remove the `red eye` when the flash has been used, and many more funcationalities
- the number of pixels in a light-sensitive cell of a camera determines the amount of memory the photo captured with occupy
- the memory occupied by the photo can be reduced by reducing its resolution

## keyboard
- each character has a uniqure ascii code
- when a key is pressed it is converted into a digital signal, which the computer interprets
- frequent use of keyboards can lead to repetitve strain injury (RIS) in hands and wrists
- Ergonomic keyboards are used to overcome this problem. This kind of keyboard supports the wrists and hands for users who do a lot of typing

## pointing devices
- the traditional form of a mouose has a mechanical ball arrangement that is connected to the computer using a USB port
- this mouse has been replaced with the optical mouse which uses a red light to detect motion in 2d coordinates
- a mouse reqeurires a desk space or flat surface for movement. a smooth, non-reflective surfact is also required
- a mouse consists of buttons for selection and a scroll wheele for movement up and down the screen

## microphone
> microphone has a diaphragm that vibrates to produce an electrical signal
<br>

> signal sent to the sound card
<br>

> converted to binary values

## voice recognition systems
- used in security systems
- it has software to compare the wave pattern of the sound from the user to the wave pattern stored in its memory
- if the two wave patters match, then the user is identified and given access to the system
- these systems are also used to give commands in cars, such as `switch on gps`, `open window`, etc

## radio frequency identification (RFID)
- RFID is a technology that identifies, and tracks tages attached to items such as cards, animals, bank cards, etc
- RFID tages are identified using electromagnetic feilds without a line of sight and even at a distance of up to 300m

- RFID chip that identifies an object consitis of a transponder and an antenna
- transponder is a device that receives a radio signal and converts it to a digital signal
- this digital data is sent to the reader device that identifies this tag

## RFID: types of tags
### active tags
- powered by batteries and are able to send signals at a greater distance from the reader
- for example tracking cars in a toll booth

### passive tages
- powered by the energy from the rfid readers radio waves
- cheaper compared to active tags and are used when the reader is less than a metre away from the tag
- For Example: contactlyess bank cards tracking devices in a shop etc

## touchscreen
| - | capacitive | infrared | resistive |
| - | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| what is it made of? | many layers of glass that act as capaciters | glass | an upper layer of polyester and a bottom layer of glass|
| how does it work? | due to changes in electric current when the glass layer is touched, the coordinates where it has been touched is sent to the microprocessor | heat-seneutive: needs a warm object to give input, optical: an array of sensors in the form of a grid determine the coordinates touched | when the polyester layer is touched  both layers connect and complete the circuit the microprocessor interprets the signal and determines the coordinates

| - | capacitive | infrared | resistive |
| - | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| advantages | medium-cost, good screen visibility (even in bright sunlight) multi-touch capability and durable | multi-touch capabiloity and durability. gloved fingers and stylus can be used to provide input of optical systems | relativly inexpensive technology. bare finers, gloved fingers and stylus can be used to provide input |
| disadvantages | bare fingers and certain stylus can only be used for input | incorrectly trigger commands. relativly expensive. sensitive to water and mousture | poor screen visibility in bright sunlight. does not permit multi-touch capability. the screen is not durable |

## sensors
sensors are devices that can read physical qyantites such as temperature, light, motion and so on.

- physical quanities are anologue in nature
- for the computer to interpret these values, an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) is used

## monitoring and control applications
- the DAC converts the digital data from the computer into analogue values that can control the output devices
- a computer can control devices such as motors, valves, etc. by using a digital-to-analogue (DAC)
- ab actuator is an electromechanical devices that controls electrical devices
- its operation is similar to that of a switch. it switches that electrical device ON and OFF according to the singlas from the computer
<br>

- an actuator is usually a relay, soenoid or motor
- a solenoid is a digital actuator and hence can directly control the electrical device when it recives digital signlas

## interactive whiteboards
- interactive whiteboards enable users to write on the whiteboard
- these changes can be saved for later use
- any application that can be used on the computer can be used on an interactive whiteboard
- software applications wuch as games can also be demonstrated using interactive whiteboards
