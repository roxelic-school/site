currently there is only one endpoint
[/api/v1/me](//music.foreverpain.lol/api/v1/me)
this currently hosts `at a glance data` which i will call upon when making dummy systems to display the data, it is also a way to view the data quickly without having to load a massive file

> id like to split recently played tracks into an enpoint with a query which tells how many of the songs to load so if youve been using this for a while it doesnt like have a 600mb json file to load
